### LIST 
for order list just mention the no

1. One
2. Two

-if we just use same no in output it'll use as 1,2,3 ex

1. A
1. B
1. D

-to go inside the list i.e **sublist** we'll just go in the next line and **press tab key** ex 

1. A
2. W
3. R
    1. u
    5. p
    1. o
        1. w
        1. s

### To mention LINKS
[Home](https://google.com "google")  
to give links we first use square brackets and then we use round brackets, in first square bracket we use button and then in round bracket we use link and then after giving link we give space and then in commas we may specify about the link. So that on hover on that button it'll pop up.

->we use 3 backticks in order if we have to write a `code snippet ` which can be more than one line.

```
for (let i=0; < cars.length; i++)
{
    text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
```

->use of single backtick (`) to highlight anything for ex : 
- Hello `let` is a keyword

![Sign]()

> hello
